    <p>To call this dog a good boy is an understatement on par with calling Tom Hanks a <q>nice guy.</q> While the inner workings of his tiny dog brain are a mystery we know a few things for sure</p>
    <ol>
      <li>He is cute as hell</li>
      <li>He is lazy as hell</li>
      <li>He fucking hates squirrels</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To truly understand the where Maverick exists now, we must first look backward to where he began. Born underneath a house in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-City,_Los_Angeles" target="_blank">mid-city</a> neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, Maverick was no stranger to the chaotic nature of fortune. After being discovered by the house's owner Maverick's family faced quick and certain eviction. It was only thanks to the kindness of one Ronnie that Maverick would receive a chance at a better life.</p>
    <p>Ronnie began spreading the word of a poor dog and her six adorable puppies that needed homes. Word which quickly reached Ronnie's co-worker and soon-to-be dog mom, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/katie.dusenbury" target="_blank">Katie Nocole Dusenbury</a>. Ms. Dusenbury had long desired to exercise her maternal instincts, however, it was not until that fateful day that she laid eyes upon that which would become her obsession. On that day, she met Maverick. With the help of her loving partner &#40;and part time Lee Harvey Oswald impersonatorpar&#41; Ms. Dusenbury transported our hero from he mid-city wasteland all the way to his new home in Echo Park.</p>
    <p>This is where I get lazy and use filler text. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur congue velit eget tempor tincidunt. Cras feugiat elit in mollis rutrum. Vivamus lorem leo, tincidunt vel lacus quis, mollis eleifend justo. Sed aliquet ante non rutrum commodo. In tempor tortor a libero malesuada pulvinar. Nulla sodales nisl vitae turpis volutpat varius. Sed et euismod velit, aliquam lobortis urna.</p>
